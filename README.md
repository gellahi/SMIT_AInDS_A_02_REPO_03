- **Description**: Print a pyramid where each number follows sequentially from 1.
- **Key Concepts**: Loops, counting patterns.

## Problem 12: Odd Number Pyramid
- **Description**: Create a pyramid using only odd numbers, increasing the count of numbers per row.
- **Key Concepts**: Loops, increment patterns.

## Problem 13: Zigzag Number Pyramid
- **Description**: Generate a zigzag pyramid with increasing numbers that reverse in each row.
- **Key Concepts**: Nested loops, reverse numbering.

## Problem 14: Symmetric Number Pyramid
- **Description**: Create a symmetric pyramid where numbers increase and then decrease on each row.
- **Key Concepts**: Nested loops, symmetry, patterns.

## Problem 15: Decreasing Number Pyramid
- **Description**: Print a pyramid where numbers decrease from a large value in each row.
- **Key Concepts**: Nested loops, decrement patterns.
